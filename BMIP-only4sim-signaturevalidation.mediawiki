==Abstract==

This BMIP describes a specification that how to verify signature in contracts.

==Motivation==

This standard will allow signature validity checking in a smart contract. Through a standard function, the contract will be able to establish an association between the blockchain and humans, groups, objects and other external systems. The contract can also trust data submitted by a third party as long as the data is signed by the trusted party. This standard will simplify the implementation of oracles and status channels.

==Specification==

Signature verification function:
<pre>
checkStrSig(s,key,sig)
</pre>

Inputs:
{|
| s || The String that was signed.
|-
| key || The PublicKey of the Signature.
|-
| sig || The Signature of the String.
|}

Outputs:
{|
| true || If Signature is valid.
|-
| false || If Signature is invalid.
|}
